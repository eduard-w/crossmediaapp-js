This project is a simple framework for 3d apps with desktop and xr support that uses three.js and three-mesh-ui for building scenes.

Include in your node projects via `npm install eduard-w/crossmediaapp-js`.

To test the example apps under `/examples` you can:
- clone this repo
- install dependencies with `npm install`
- start a dev server in your local network with `npx vite --host`
- launch the example html files from either a desktop browser, mobile browser or inside a vr-set.
